# HSDA Bulk

The HSDA bulk protocol is defined by [openapi-hsda-bulk.yaml](../static/openapi-hsda-bulk.yaml). The details below show the available methods and responses. 

This is a service for handling bulk loading of data into any HSDA service, allowing each POST and PUT to be queued up as a job, and be run on schedule, or based upon other events.

You can also [explore this using our OpenAPI viewer](../../../_static/swagger/?url=../openapi-hsda-bulk.yaml). 

```eval_rst
.. warning::
    
    This is an experimental feature. Feedback is welcome to shape its further development.

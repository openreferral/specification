# HSDA Meta 

The HSDA meta protocol is defined by [openapi-hsda-meta.yaml](../static/openapi-hsda-meta.yaml). The details below show the available methods and responses. 

This is a HSDA service specifically intended to manage the meta data around human services data API operations. Essentially this is a logging system, providing access to data about what API calls are made, managing individual resources, as well as any other service in use association with HSDA operations.

You can also [explore this using our OpenAPI viewer](../../_static/swagger/?url=../openapi-hsda-meta.yaml).

Open Referral's agenda is set by the prerogatives of a set of four types of users: 
* help seekers;
* service providers;
* researchers/analysts;
* database administrators. 

 Read more about each of these personas in [our User Personas documentation]([https://docs.openreferral.org/en/documentation-review/initiative/index.html#types-of-use-and-user-personas]).

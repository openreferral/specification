API Reference
=============

The API reference provides an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification that can be used as a blueprint for the design or adaptation of API platforms to provide read or read/write access to information on organizations, services, locations and the details about them. The API protocol  provides most of the functionality needed for simple access and exchange of data.

 
```{eval-rst}
Along with this reference, there is `a swagger ui version of the API <../openapi.html>`_
```

The source of the specification is found on [GitHub](https://github.com/openreferral/specification/tree/latest/schema/openapi.json) and [issues can be raised in the issue tracker](https://github.com/openreferral/specification/issues).

## Lists

Web endpoints that return lists of entities, such as services returned by a `/services` endpoint must be paginated.

The header returned must include these properties:

- `"total_items"`: the total number of entities (e.g. services) returned
- `"total_pages"`: the total number of pages
- `"page_number"`: the number of the current page
- `"size"`: the number of entities in aq page
- `"first_page"`: a Boolean value indicating if this is the first page
- `"last_page"`: a Boolean value indicating if this is the last page
- `"empty"`: a Boolean value indicating if there is an empty result set

After the header, a lists endpoint will contain an array of its main entities (e.g. services). The array will normally contain all direct properties of each item but need not contain arrays of child entities (e.g. service contacts).

## Metadata

In HSDS each object has an optional `metadata` field containing a [metadata object](/schema_reference.md#metadata). Since an API response may contain a list of many objects &mdash; each with their own nested objects &mdash; this could result in a large quantity of metadata in the response.

It should be noted that the `metadata` field in each object is optional, and API implementors should consider what is an appropriate level of metadata to include in each response based on their use-case.

## Endpoint details

This section contains details of each API endpoint. Each section presents an endpoint defined by the API and presents a technical reference for that endpoint including query parameters, status codes, and compliance rules for HSDS and Open Referral UK.

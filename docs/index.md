The Open Referral Initiative develops data standards and open platforms that make it easy to share and find information about community resources. Learn more about the initiative at [OpenReferral.org](https://www.openreferral.org).

## Data Specifications

This site contains documentation for the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) and the API specification. 

These can be used to structure and exchange information about the accessibility of health, human, and social services. Specifically, the HSDS describes data about organizations, the services they provide, the locations at which these services can be accessed, and associated details. It also describes protocols for accessing and managing this data. 

## Our ecosystem

**Open Referralâ€™s ecosystem** includes a range of working open source software applications that can be freely redeployed to work with HSDS-compatible data and/or APIs. Many of these tools can be found in [our Github organization](http://github.com/openreferral).

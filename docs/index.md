The Open Referral Initiative develops data standards and open platforms that make it easy to share and find information about community resources. Learn more about the about at [OpenReferral.org](https://www.openreferral.org).

## Using this documentation

This documentation contains reference materials and guidance related to various aspects of the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), as well as the Open Referral Initiative itself.

### Data Specifications

Pages inside the *HSDS Reference* section of the docs provide reference materials for HSDS. These materials are considered *normative* and should be given priority over all other materials about HSDS, excepting the canonical HSDS schemas provided on our [Github repository](https://github.com/openreferral/specification).

The contents of the *HSDS Reference Section* contains specifications for HSDS' data model, API reference, and HSDS Profiles. It also contains normative materials defining what it means to be conformant to HSDS, how identifiers of various kinds are used in HSDS, and how HSDS should be serialized.

### Implementation Guidance

Pages inside the *HSDS Implementation Guidance* section provide additional materials about specific topics in HSDS. These materials are *informative* rather than normative and therefore should not take precedence over materials inside the *HSDS Reference* section.

The contents of the *HSDS Implementation Guidance* are intended to be used by implementors, but may also be useful for data users wanting to understand more about HSDS to support their analysis.

### Comment on our docs using Hypothes.is

This documentation supports community comments via [Hypothesi.is](https://web.hypothes.is/).

Hypothes.is is an annotation service embedded into this documentation site. You may notice some text highlighted in yellow, or the button in the top right of each page which reveals the list of annotations for that page.

To get involved in annotating the documentation, you'll need to create an account at Hypothes.is, but it's otherwise as simple as highlighting some text on the page and using the pop-up box to add your comments.

## Our ecosystem

**Open Referralâ€™s ecosystem** includes a range of working open source software applications that can be freely redeployed to work with HSDS-compatible data and/or APIs. Many of these tools can be found in [our Github organization](http://github.com/openreferral).

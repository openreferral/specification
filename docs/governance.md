You can contribute to the development of the specification in two ways:

Anyone can view and search the issues already raised. You will need to sign-up for a free GitHub account to comment or create issues.

There is also a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openreferral)where discussions around the specification are encouraged

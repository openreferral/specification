The Open Referral Initiative is led by Greg Bloom ([@greggish](https://github.com/greggish)). Its launch in 2014 was co-sponsored by [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org), with funding from [the Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org). 

The Human Services Data Specification is developed under the technical stewardship of [the Open Data Services Cooperative](http://opendataservices.coop/) (read more [here](https://openreferral.org/meet-the-open-data-services-cooperative/)). 

Open Referral's [Explainer Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHsIZhACSVc) was made possible by a small grant from [the Shuttleworth Foundation](http://shuttleworthfoundation.org/).

Our work is made possible by a broad array of supporters and contributors. Thank you for all that you do!

## Understanding website visitor and traffic patterns

We collect data about your visits to the website, for the purpose of analysing how the website is used, so that we can improve it. A self hosted copy of [Matomo](http://matomo.org) is used for this.

Personal data we collect:

* Your IP address - this is pseudonymised by redacting the second half of the address
* Referrer (what page you arrived at one of our web pages from)
* Information about your device, OS and browser

We do not use this data to personally identify individuals, but it is possible that it could be used to do so, particularly if combined with other datasets.

You can opt out of this processing: If you have set your web browser to "I do not want to be tracked" (DoNotTrack is enabled) then Matomo will not track your visit.

Matomo also itâ€™s own opt out mechanism:
